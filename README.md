## Reminder

This is a public repository created by a group of 2019 undergraduates at Hangzhou University of Electronic Science and Technology to collate data from past projects, and we have uploaded some of the non-private content here for safekeeping.

****

## Introduction

The aim of the project is to build a digital Chinese painting-style migration applet based on generative adversarial networks(GAN). The GAN model we finally use is a [few-shot-gan-adaptation](https://github.com/utkarshojha/few-shot-gan-adaptation).

Below are some of the results of our projects. Attached is a report on the process during the project and the data sets used.
